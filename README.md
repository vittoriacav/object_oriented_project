# object_oriented_project

## Input ##
The file gene_table.csv contains summary annotation on all human genes, based on the
Ensembl annotation
For each gene, this file contains:
- gene_name based on the HGNC nomenclature;
- gene_biotype for example protein_coding, pseudogene, lincRNA, miRNA etc;
- chromosome on which the gene is located;
- strand on which the gene is located;
- transcript_count the number of known isoforms of the gene.

## General Goal ##
Write a program able to:
1. parse the dataset;
2. analyse the data;
3. compute relevant outcomes based on arithmetic and statistical operations;
4. present the user with relevant outcomes.

The program must be designed and implemented in Python by using the Object-Oriented paradigm. Additionally, the dataset management and presentation must rely on Pandas and Flask, respectively.
